### 🔹 LLMOps — Fine-Tuning & Agentic RAG Systems
Implemented an end-to-end LLMOps pipeline covering data ingestion, retrieval, generation, and deployment. Built agentic RAG workflows using advanced retrievers (MMR, contextual compression), reranking, query rewriting, and tool-calling via MCP. Designed asynchronous agent flows with validation, memory, fallback to web search, and production-ready deployment with APIs and CI/CD.

---

### 🔹 RAG-Based Document Intelligence System
Built a document ingestion, semantic search, and chat system using RAG to enable intelligent querying across large technical document collections.

---

### 🔹 E-Commerce Product Assistant (Real-Time)
Developed a real-time AI assistant combining static product data with live web data using agent-based RAG pipelines and backend services.

---

### 🔹 Multi-Agent Research Automation
Designed multi-agent workflows for automated research tasks including search, analysis, and report generation with coordinated agent orchestration.
